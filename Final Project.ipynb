        "## 1. Theoretical Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand the core concepts you will be implementing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)\n",
        "\n",
        "VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to find the minimum eigenvalue of a large matrix (Hamiltonian), a problem central to quantum physics and optimization. The process works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hamiltonian Mapping**:  \n",
        "  The problem of finding a molecule's ground state energy is translated into finding the minimum eigenvalue of its corresponding Hamiltonian operator, $H$.  \n",
        "  This Hamiltonian can be expressed as a weighted sum of Pauli operators (combinations of $I$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$).  \n",
        "  For this assignment, the Hamiltonian for the Hydrogen molecule ($H_2$) is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Ansatz**:  \n",
        "  An \"ansatz\" is a parameterized quantum circuit, $U(\\vec{\\theta})$, that prepares a guess quantum state, $|\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\rangle$.  \n",
        "  The quality of the ansatz is crucial for the success of VQE.  \n",
        "  We'll use a generic but effective hardware-efficient ansatz called `TwoLocal`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Expectation Value Measurement**:  \n",
        "  The quantum computer prepares the state $|\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\rangle$ and measures the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:  \n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  \\langle E(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(\\vec{\\theta}) | H | \\psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Classical Optimization**:  \n",
        "  A classical optimizer (e.g., SPSA, COBYLA) uses $\\langle E(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle$ as its cost function.  \n",
        "  The optimizer suggests a new set of parameters, $\\vec{\\theta}'$, with the goal of minimizing the energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the **variational principle**, the lowest energy found is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the true ground state energy.\n",

        "\n",
        "Current quantum computers are **noisy**. Environmental interactions and imperfect controls cause errors.  \n",
        "A common type of error is a **bit-flip** error, where a qubit in state $|0\\rangle$ flips to $|1\\rangle$ (or vice-versa).  \n",
        "This is equivalent to a Pauli-$X$ gate being unintentionally applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such errors corrupt quantum states and lead to inaccurate results — which you’ll observe in your noisy VQE simulation.\n",

        "### Quantum Error Correction (QEC)\n",
        "\n",
        "QEC protects quantum information from noise by encoding a logical qubit into multiple physical qubits.  \n",
        "This allows detection and correction of errors without collapsing the logical information.\n",

        "  If a bit-flip occurs (e.g., $|000\\rangle \\rightarrow |010\\rangle$), the state leaves the valid code space.  \n",
        "  Measure **stabilizers**: $Z_0Z_1$ and $Z_1Z_2$.  \n",
        "  The measurement outcomes form a **syndrome** to identify the flipped qubit.\n",
